## ‚ú® Feature Overview

### `1` CLI & APP

The application, with aria2 at its core, offers two modes of use:

- Command line
- UI

This caters to the needs of different users.

Both the command line and UI have simple localization support (supporting `en-US` and `zh-CN`), and can switch automatically according to the current system language.

> \[!TIP]
>
> The UI is based on the Windows App SDK, which requires your system version to be Windows 10 19043 and above. It is highly recommended to download and install from the Microsoft Store.

### `2` Built-in Aria2

I have to say, the sole motivation for building this tool was that I couldn't find a convenient, reliable download tool to download entire repositories from hugging face. Either there's no progress indication, or the robustness is too poor.

My technical skills aren't great, but [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) has left a good impression on me in the past, so I chose to build a simple download tool based on it.

The download has the following features:

1. Customizable download directory
2. Support for resuming downloads
3. Complete progress display
4. Ability to operate on individual items, pause/resume/cancel **(App only)**

Both CLI and APP come with a built-in `1.3.7` **aria2c.exe**, no additional download required, trying to be as plug and play as possible.
